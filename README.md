#  AnalogClock

This is a work-in-progress for now.

The goal is a simple iOS app that draws an analog clock of the current time (as well as displaying a digital readout of the time and date as well). 

This is a SwiftUI rewrite of an [earlier start](https://github.com/reuschj/AnalogClock-Legacy).

#### Current features:
- An analog clock, which can be toggled between 12-hour, 24-hour and decimal time
- A digit clock display (optional)
- A date display (optional)
- A settings panel
- Themable with one custom theme (Impact)
- An (optional) tick/tock pendulum display
- An (optional) AM/PM hand for the analog clock
